                     Time Synchronization over QUIC
                         draft-mccollum-tsq-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a modern, secure, and extensible time
   synchronization protocol designed to operate over the QUIC transport
   protocol.  Known as TSQ (Time Synchronization over QUIC), this
   protocol aims to address the limitations of traditional NTP by
   leveraging QUIC's encryption, widespread UDP/443 acceptance, and
   multiplexed stream capabilities.  TSQ is designed for contemporary
   deployment environments, including enterprise networks, cloud-native
   systems, containers, and mobile devices, where traditional UDP-based
   NTP struggles with security, scalability, or operational reliability.

1.  Introduction

   Time synchronization is foundational to modern computing.  It
   underpins authentication systems, log correlation, distributed
   transactions, and more.  NTP, the current standard, was designed in a
   different era and brings challenges related to security, deployment
   compatibility, and extensibility.  TSQ is proposed as a new protocol
   built directly on top of QUIC, leveraging its modern transport
   features to provide secure, authenticated, and operationally-friendly
   time synchronization.

2.  Scope and Goals

   TSQ is intended to:

   *  Provide secure and authenticated time synchronization

   *  Support modern deployment scenarios

   *  Operate in environments where UDP/123 is blocked

Internet-Draft                     TSQ                         July 2025


   *  Be extensible and future-proof

   *  Scale for enterprise and cloud

   TSQ is _not_ intended to:

   *  Replace NTP in ultra-precise or constrained devices

   *  Replace public NTP infrastructure without optimization

3.  Protocol Overview

   TSQ uses QUIC as its transport, establishing secure, short-lived
   connections.  A typical exchange:

   1.  Client opens a QUIC connection to the TSQ server (UDP/443).

   2.  Client sends a TSQ Request with nonce and timestamp request.

   3.  Server replies with timestamps, echoed nonce, and metadata.

   4.  Client calculates RTT and adjusts clock accordingly.

4.  Security and Threat Model

   TSQ relies on QUIC’s handshake for mutual authentication,
   confidentiality, and replay protection.  Optional Ed25519 or HMAC
   signatures can be added if auditability is required.  By default,
   QUIC session integrity suffices.

5.  Scalability Considerations

   Short-lived connections, session resumption, and optional stateless
   design support scalability.  TSQ is suitable for enterprise and cloud
   deployments.

6.  Message Format (TLV)

   *TSQ Request*

   *  Type: 0x01

   *  Nonce (16 bytes)

   *  Optional extensions

   *TSQ Response*

9.  QUIC Overview

   QUIC is a UDP-based transport protocol that provides multiplexed,
   stream-based delivery with built-in encryption and connection
   migration.  It combines transport and cryptographic handshake layers,
   simplifying deployment behind NATs and firewalls.  TSQ builds on QUIC
   to inherit its confidentiality, integrity, and path-resilience
   characteristics.

10.  Clarification of Mobile Support

   Mobile support in TSQ leverages QUIC's connection ID and migration
   capabilities.  When a mobile device changes IP addresses (e.g., Wi-Fi
   to LTE), the QUIC connection remains valid as long as the connection
   ID is preserved, enabling uninterrupted time synchronization.

11.  Clarification of Precision Mode

   Precision Mode refers to TSQ’s optional support for fixed-length
   packets and constant-time processing.  This reduces jitter introduced
   by variable processing times and packet sizes, improving accuracy in
   latency-sensitive environments.

12.  Explanation of Server Time Field

   The Server Time field in TSQ responses provides a consistent
   reference for clients even when timestamp echoing is used.  Including
   it explicitly simplifies validation and debugging, particularly when
   clock discrepancies or replay concerns are involved.

13.  Packet Symmetry Considerations

   To minimize timing variance, TSQ recommends maintaining symmetry
   between request and response packet sizes.  While QUIC encrypts and
   pads payloads, preserving symmetry at the application level helps
   reduce bias in round-trip delay calculations.

14.  QUIC Multiplexing and Port 443

   TSQ can coexist with other protocols over QUIC on port 443 using
   Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN).  This avoids conflicts
   and enables unified endpoint services, allowing TSQ to blend with
   HTTPS or other QUIC-based services on the same port.

15.  QUIC Datagram Crypto Considerations

   TSQ may also use QUIC datagrams for lightweight synchronization.
   These datagrams are encrypted and authenticated using the same keys
   as QUIC streams but offer unreliable delivery.  The transport-layer
   AEAD encryption offloads per-packet crypto from the application,
   maintaining confidentiality without additional cost to TSQ servers.

16.  Next Steps

   *  Solicit feedback on sync behavior and design

   *  Improve trust and crypto model

   *  Implement prototype in QUIC

   *  Submit official Internet-Draft if interest grows

17.  Acknowledgments

   Thanks to contributors from the QUIC and NTP working groups for input
   on timing accuracy and protocol design.

18.  Relationship to Roughtime

   Roughtime [ROUGHTIME] is a secure time authentication protocol
   designed to provide coarse-grained time (typically accurate within a
   few seconds) using cryptographic proofs.  It is particularly useful
   in scenarios where a system needs to verify that its clock is
   reasonably accurate before performing sensitive operations such as
   certificate validation.

   Unlike TSQ, which aims to deliver secure and precise time
   synchronization suitable for continuous use in enterprise, mobile,
   and containerized environments, Roughtime focuses on bootstrapping
   trust in time from potentially untrusted states.  Roughtime servers
   are stateless and optimized for high-throughput, low-complexity
   validation rather than tight synchronization.

   As such, TSQ and Roughtime serve complementary purposes.  Roughtime
   may help systems establish an initial level of temporal trust, while
   TSQ provides ongoing synchronization over a secure and extensible
   transport protocol.
